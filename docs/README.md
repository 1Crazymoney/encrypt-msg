- [Uncensorable Encrypted Messaging using BCH and IPFS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB9yt65y9s8) is a 'Part 2' YouTube video that extends the first video. It demonstrates the ability to use IPFS to move data off-chain, allow it to scale to any size, and possibly be self-destructing after a period of time. Showed off the [IPFS hosting service on FullStack.cash](https://ipfs.fullstack.cash).

- [CoinSpice.io Podcast](https://coinspice.io/news/podcast-bitcoin-cash-devs-prepper-mentality-makes-him-ready-for-cryptos-privacy-future/) discussed the political crackdown on end-to-end encryption via the EARN IT act, and how Bitcoin-based e2e encryption as a solution to government overreach.

- [Encrypted Messages on the Blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrmteYmbmM&t=1s) was the first YouTube video that demonstrated the potential for using the same encryption behind the Bitcoin protocol to encrypt messages. This ultimately resulted in the [e2e encrypted messaging feature now available on member.cash](https://member.cash/#messages).
